## Premier League Simulation

 In this simulation, there will be a group of football teams and the simulation will show match results and the league table. We estimate the final league table. 

League Rules: 
There will be four teams in the league. 
Other rules in the league (scoring, points, goal difference, etc.) will be the same as the rules of the Premier League.
• After you click on the all-League Play button, play the matches automatically until the end of the League and list the results of the matches by weeks. 
• Edit the results of the matches and calculate the edited results of the matches based on the content of the modified standings.
